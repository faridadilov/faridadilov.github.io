# Welcome to my personal website


I have comprehensive experience in computational biology through both research and teaching roles. I am an Honorary Fellow in the School of Life Sciences at the University of Essex. My research interests are targetting steroid receptor signalling in diagnosing and treating cancer disease, the application of data science and machine learning in cancer research. Previously, I worked as a Lecturer in Biology and Specialist Technician at Essex. I hold my PhD in Molecular Medicine and Postgraduate Certificate in Higher Education Practice (PG CHEP) from the University of Essex. I am a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA).
