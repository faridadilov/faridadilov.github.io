# Welcome to my personal website


Currently, I pursue a PhD in Sociology at the University of Essex, UK. My research explores the impact of women members of parliament on women-friendly policies addressing domestic violence, reproductive rights and health, early marriage, and parental leave.

My research interests entail women‚Äôs political representation, gender and public policy, and gender equality policies. I have a professional background in developing women and child-friendly policies, programmes that address a wide range of issues to strengthen the protection of women and children‚Äôs rights. I previously served as a member of the Gender Equality Commission of the Council of Europe (2021-2023) and as a Resident Twinning Adviser Counterpart, managing a project to strengthen referral mechanisms for providing safety and support for victims of domestic violence in Azerbaijan. 

I recently completed a Postgraduate Certificate in Higher Education Practice (Module 1) and gained professional recognition as a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA). I earned my MA in International Politics (Globalization, Poverty and Development) from Newcastle University.
